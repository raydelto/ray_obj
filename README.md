# Raydelto in 3D

This is a simple test of 3D models created with iPad's LIDAR. This simple web app loads an OBJ generated based on the point cloud using the THREE.js javascript library.

If you are interested in loading 3D models on a WEB browsers you might find this other project interesting:
[MD2 Model Web Loader](https://github.com/raydelto/md2-loader-web "Web")

If you're interested in MD2 loaders, I've created this other MD2 loaders for desktop and Android platforms:

* [Desktop MD2 Loader(Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux) using C++ with OpenGL and GLFW](https://github.com/raydelto/md2loader-glfw "Desktop")
* [Android MD2 Loader with Kotlin, C++ and OpenGL ES](https://github.com/raydelto/opengles-md2loader-android "Android")
